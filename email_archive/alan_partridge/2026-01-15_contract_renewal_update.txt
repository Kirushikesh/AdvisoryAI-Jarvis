Morning Abimanyu,

Just a quick note to let you know the contract renewal has gone through.

Confirmed for another year on the same terms and salary. Given the state of the industry, I’d say that’s a fairly emphatic vote of confidence from the station.

Hopefully that puts some of the more pessimistic projections to bed, at least in the short term.

We can go through the implications properly at the review.

Best,
Alan
