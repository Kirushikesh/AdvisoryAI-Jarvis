Subject: Good to Speak Earlier

Hi Brian,

Thank you for the call earlier. I know it wasn’t an easy conversation.

There’s no urgency to decide anything immediately. When you’re ready, we can walk through the options for helping Sarah calmly and fairly, and also look at simplifying the accounts that are causing frustration.

Let’s take this one step at a time.

Best,
Abimanyu
