Subject: New Role Offer – Thoughts?

Hi Abimanyu,

As mentioned briefly on the phone, I’ve been offered a new role.

Salary £75k, bonus £12k, so financially it’s a step up. Commute is longer (South London to Reading) and I’m slightly concerned about work-life balance, especially with the house move and wedding this year.

One thing I haven’t fully checked yet is maternity policy, which feels relevant given our plans.

Could you let me know how you’d weigh this up financially?

Thanks,
Antony
