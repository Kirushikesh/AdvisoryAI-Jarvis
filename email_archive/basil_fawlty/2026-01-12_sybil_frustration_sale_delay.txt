Subject: Hotel Sale – Next Steps

Abimanyu,

I’m becoming increasingly frustrated that we’re no further forward.

Another winter closure has come and gone, and I don’t want to be doing this again next year. I know Basil still believes the hotel is worth more, but at some point we need to prioritise our lives over an ideal price.

I’d appreciate your view on how hard we need to push on this.

Kind regards,
Sybil
