Abimanyu,

I’ve reviewed the agent’s comments again and I still don’t accept that £1.45m is unrealistic.

This hotel is a unique proposition, and I won’t give it away simply because the market lacks imagination. We’ve invested decades into this place.

I’m happy to discuss tactics, but I won’t agree to unnecessary reductions.

Regards,
Basil
