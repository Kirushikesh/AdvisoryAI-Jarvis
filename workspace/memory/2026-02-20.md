- Hyacinth Bucket (C018): always pronounce surname as "Bouquet" in any verbal or voice interaction — she is sensitive about this. Written communication with "Bucket" is fine.
- Hyacinth and Richard (both 73 and 75) have no Lasting Powers of Attorney in place — this is a serious and urgent gap. If either loses mental capacity, managing finances becomes legally complex. LPA conversation must not be postponed beyond the next meeting.
- Wills are also not up to date — at their age and with ~£625k net worth (mostly property), IHT planning and estate wishes need to be current. Refer to solicitor at the next review.
- Son Sheridan (45) is financially dependent and has an unrepaid £25k loan. Hyacinth tends to agree to additional support; Richard is reluctant. Frame any boundary-setting as "protecting their own retirement security" — avoid any language that sounds critical of Sheridan directly.
- Monthly lifestyle costs are tightly matched to pension income (~£3,200/month target) with very little buffer. Savings depletion is projected for early 2030s at current trajectory — any unexpected cost (care, car, Sheridan support) accelerates this significantly.
- Mediterranean cruise and £35k car are both aspirational goals that are unaffordable at current savings levels. Do not flatly discourage — instead redirect to realistic budgets (car: ~£18k) and structured saving plans. Hyacinth responds better to gentle reframing than a hard no.
- Hyacinth is the dominant voice in meetings; Richard is quieter but holds more cautious instincts. Both respond well when the meeting opens with what's going well before raising concerns. Prefer phone contact over email — Hyacinth rarely checks her TalkTalk account.
- UK interest rates remain elevated vs pre-2022 norms — clients with mortgages expiring need 6–9 month lead time on remortgage planning. Defined Benefit pensions are widely undervalued by clients; always foreground DB income in retirement projections.
- When a client has a major life event (bereavement, divorce, redundancy), book a check-in within 2 weeks rather than waiting for the annual review cycle.
