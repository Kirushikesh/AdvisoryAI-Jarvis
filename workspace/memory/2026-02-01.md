- Emma Thompson (C004): mortgage fix expires March 2027 — remortgage conversation needs to happen by Q3 2026. Balance is ~£185k on a £495k property; tracker vs fix decision depends on the rate environment at the time.
- Emma Thompson: old AstraZeneca pension (£68k) is still unconsolidated — consolidation into her current SIPP has been discussed but not actioned. Worth revisiting at next review.
- Emma Thompson: mother has early-stage dementia — care costs are a realistic possibility in 2–4 years. Consider earmarking a portion of her savings for this; raise annually without alarm.
- Emma Thompson: sabbatical fund target is £60k by 2030 — she has flagged burnout risk multiple times. Treat this as a near-term planning priority, not an aspirational nice-to-have.
- Emma Thompson: partner Tom (architect, £78k) is not cohabiting and there are no legal protections in place. If the relationship progresses, flag cohabitation agreement, property implications, and will update — raise gently once a year.
- David Chen (C003): mortgage fix expired May 2026 — balance £285k, rate was 2.89%. Should have remortgaged by now; confirm status at next interaction.
- David Chen: school fees run at £72k/year until 2031 — this dominates cashflow and must be front of mind in any cashflow planning or investment recommendation.
- David Chen: £140k in unvested Goldman Sachs share options — high concentration risk. Recommend de-risking on each vest event and reviewing tax implications (employer NI, income tax) in advance.
- David Chen: VCT contribution of ~£30k recommended annually — remind each February/March before April 5th deadline. Key tax efficiency lever given his income level.
- David Chen: if he ever signals a career change, the entire plan changes — loss of £185k salary and Goldman pension contributions would require immediate re-planning. Keep this risk in mind when reviewing.
