- Advisor prefers concise bullet summaries — avoid long prose, especially in heartbeat updates. Morning briefings should lead with calendar and urgent emails first, then market colour.
- Always draft client emails for advisor review before sending — never send autonomously. Flag drafts clearly and wait for explicit approval.
- Review meetings tend to cluster on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons — avoid scheduling conflicts during these windows.
- ISA season peaks in March — proactively remind all relevant clients to top up from late January before the April 5th deadline.
- Annual allowances to track each tax year: ISA (£20k/person), Junior ISA (£9k/child), pension (£60k or carry-forward), capital gains, and gift allowances (£3k annual, £250 small gifts).
- When a client's fixed-rate mortgage is within 6 months of expiry, flag it immediately — rates can move quickly and lenders need lead time.
- Finance-sector clients (banking, pharma) tend to receive bonuses Jan–March — use this window to prompt pension sacrifice and ISA top-up conversations before the money lands.
- Vulnerable client flags must be reviewed and documented at every annual meeting — re-assess suitability if circumstances change materially (job loss, divorce, inheritance, health event).
- Never make investment recommendations without routing through Colin (compliance agent) first. Always cite sources when sharing market commentary with clients.
- Post-meeting follow-up emails should go within 24h while details are fresh — Jarvis can draft for approval but should not send directly.
