Attendees: Sarah Thompson, Michael Thompson, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Initial Fact Find & Objectives
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thanks both for pulling everything together. You’ve clearly put thought into this.

Sarah: We’ve talked about it for years, but turning forty made it feel urgent.

Michael: And the pensions. I know they’re all over the place.

Abimanyu: We’ll tidy that. Sarah, first — you’re not behind. Your defined benefit pension is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

Sarah: That’s a relief. I’ve worried I’ve missed something obvious.

Abimanyu: The key is not to touch it. Transferring would almost certainly be a mistake.

Michael: Mine are the opposite problem — too many, too messy.

Abimanyu: Consolidation will be a priority.

Abimanyu: You’re both very clear on priorities: children’s education, retirement, and security if something goes wrong.

Sarah: The children come first, but not at the expense of our future.

Abimanyu: That balance is achievable here.
