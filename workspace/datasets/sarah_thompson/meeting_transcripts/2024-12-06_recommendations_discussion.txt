Date: 06 December 2024
Attendees: Sarah Thompson, Michael Thompson, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Recommendations & Risk Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: I want to start with protection. Sarah, you’re well covered. Michael, you’re not.

Michael: I suspected that.

Abimanyu: Given your health history and children, critical illness is a real gap.

Sarah: I agree. We shouldn’t ignore that.

Abimanyu: On pensions, consolidation saves money and removes admin drag. It’s not optional long-term.

Michael: Understood. I need a nudge sometimes.

Abimanyu: I’ll provide that.

Abimanyu: On retirement, £50k is achievable, but we should model £60k so there are no surprises.

Sarah: I’d rather be conservative.

Abimanyu: Sensible. That’s exactly how we’ll plan.
