Attendees: Gareth Cheeseman, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Housing Options & Relationship Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Let’s focus on housing and Sarah, because they’re linked.

Gareth: That’s the bit I find hardest. I don’t want to repeat mistakes.

Abimanyu: Which is why joint purchase now carries unnecessary risk.

Gareth: Agreed. Renting or moving into her place feels safer.

Abimanyu: With a cohabitation agreement if you move in.

Gareth: Yes. I want clarity, not drama.
