Date: 14 January 2026
Attendees: Antony Makepeace, Beverley Makepeace, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Wedding, Property Purchase & Risk Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thanks both for coming in. I want to focus today on the legal and risk side as well as the house purchase.

Antony: That’s fine. I know there are a few loose ends we need to tighten.

Beverley: I keep meaning to deal with the paperwork, it just gets pushed down the list.

Abimanyu: I’ll be direct then. While you’re unmarried, the current setup leaves you both exposed. Life insurance not in trust is the most urgent gap.

Beverley: If something happened, it wouldn’t automatically go to Antony?

Abimanyu: Correct. Without a trust, it could end up delayed or going elsewhere entirely.

Antony: That’s not acceptable. We’ll prioritise it.

Abimanyu: Good. Wills are the other critical item. Antony, your will still leaves everything to your parents. Beverley, you don’t have one at all.

Beverley: Yes… that’s overdue.

Abimanyu: Especially with a property purchase coming up, this needs to be resolved before you exchange.

Abimanyu: On the house, your savings rate is strong. You’re on track for a sixty-thousand-pound deposit by April.

Antony: That’s reassuring.

Abimanyu: One note of caution: the mortgage will rely on both incomes. Beverley, as you’re self-employed, income protection is strongly advised.

Beverley: I know. I’ve just never quite got round to it.

Abimanyu: This is one of those areas where delaying carries real risk.

Abimanyu: Finally, Antony, the job offer. Financially positive, but I’d want clarity on maternity benefits before recommending a move.

Antony: That’s helpful. I’ll get that detail before deciding.

Abimanyu: Perfect. Immediate actions are trusts, wills, and mortgage in principle. Everything else builds on that foundation.
