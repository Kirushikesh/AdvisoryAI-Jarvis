Subject: Life Insurance Trust Forms – Important

Hi Antony, hi Beverley,

Just a reminder to complete and return the life insurance trust forms.

As discussed, while you’re unmarried the policies won’t protect each other unless they’re written in trust. This is one of the most important actions to complete before the house purchase progresses.

If helpful, I’m very happy to walk through the forms with you on a quick call.

Best,
Abimanyu
