Subject: Pension Consolidation – Forms Re-sent

Hi Anil,

I’ve re-sent the pension consolidation paperwork for the Accenture and Deloitte schemes.

As a reminder, current charges are costing roughly £800 per year more than necessary. Once completed, this becomes a set-and-forget improvement.

Let me know if you want me to walk through the forms quickly — otherwise, please aim to return these this month.

Best,
Abimanyu
