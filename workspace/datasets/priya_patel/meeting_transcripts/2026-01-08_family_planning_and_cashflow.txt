Attendees: Priya Patel, Anil Patel, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Cashflow Priorities, Family Planning & Risk
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thanks both. I want to focus today on priorities rather than new ideas.

Priya: That’s helpful. Bandwidth is the main issue.

Abimanyu: First priority remains the emergency fund. You’re at eighteen thousand, target is thirty.

Anil: Childcare costs ending this year should help.

Abimanyu: Exactly. From September, that eight hundred a month should be redirected automatically.

Priya: Agreed.

Abimanyu: Next, Anil, pension consolidation. This is low effort, high impact.

Anil: I know. I just need to sit down and do it.

Abimanyu: You’re paying for procrastination here.

Anil: Fair.

Abimanyu: On protection, I’m still concerned about income protection. Three children, a mortgage, and self-employed income is not a trivial risk.

Anil: I hear you. Once the emergency fund is complete, let’s revisit.

Abimanyu: Fine. Estate planning is the other gap. Your wills pre-date Zara and guardianship needs updating.

Priya: That’s non-negotiable. I’ll book a solicitor.

Abimanyu: Good. Finally, the loft conversion. Using company reserves remains the cleanest option from a tax perspective.

Anil: That makes sense.

Abimanyu: Then the plan is execution, not redesign. I’ll keep pushing where needed.
