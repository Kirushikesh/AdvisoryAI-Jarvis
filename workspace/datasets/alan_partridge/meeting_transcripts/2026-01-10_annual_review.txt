Attendees: Alan Partridge, Lynne Partridge, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Annual Review & Retirement Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Morning Alan, morning Lynne. Good to see you both. Lynne, before we dive into numbers, how’s your back holding up?

Lynne: Honestly, not great. Sitting all day is getting harder, and by the end of the week I’m exhausted.

Alan: She’s underselling it a bit. Though she won’t hear a word about slowing down.

Abimanyu: It’s important context, especially with the retirement timeline we’ve been discussing.

Lynne: I don’t want to stop abruptly, but I can’t see myself doing five days indefinitely.

Abimanyu: That’s why the phased reduction option still makes sense.

Abimanyu: Alan, let’s talk about the contract renewal. You sounded fairly upbeat in your email.

Alan: I am. Another year secured, same salary, no drama. People keep acting like radio’s finished — it isn’t, if you’re good.

Abimanyu: Short-term security definitely helps. Longer term, though, the projections haven’t changed materially.

Alan: Go on.

Abimanyu: As things stand, retirement income is tracking around forty-three thousand a year.

Alan: Which doesn’t exactly spell disaster.

Abimanyu: It’s twelve thousand below your stated target. That gap doesn’t close without increasing pension input.

Alan: I don’t love the idea of locking money away when life’s still happening.

Lynne: I’d sleep better knowing it’s there.

Abimanyu: An £8,000 salary sacrifice is still the cleanest fix. Tax-efficient, low friction.

Abimanyu: On the Lexus — forty-five thousand cash still the plan?

Alan: Absolutely. No finance. I want to enjoy it.

Abimanyu: Nearly-new at around forty thousand still reduces depreciation meaningfully.

Alan: I’ll think about it.

Abimanyu: And the villa. You’ve viewed, but no decision yet.

Lynne: I’d prefer to rent first, see how it feels.

Alan: I don’t want to miss the window.

Abimanyu: Which is why we agreed any purchase would be capped at one hundred and fifty thousand, if it happens at all.

Abimanyu: Before the next review: decision on pension contributions, further villa analysis, Lexus test drives, and Lynne to follow up with GP or physio.

Alan: Fine. Let’s regroup with firmer numbers.

Abimanyu: That’s exactly what we’ll do.
