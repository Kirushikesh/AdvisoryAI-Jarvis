Topic: Retirement Modelling & NHS Pension
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Rebecca, your NHS pension does a lot of the heavy lifting here.

Rebecca: Even if I drop a day?

Abimanyu: It slows accrual, but doesn’t derail the plan.

James: That’s reassuring.

Abimanyu: James, consolidation of your old pensions will improve clarity and reduce drag.

James: Happy to do that once the emergency fund is finished.
