**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 08 September 2024
Attendees: James Martinez, Rebecca Martinez, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Initial Fact Find & Priorities
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: You’re both in a strong position, but there are a lot of moving parts.

James: That’s exactly how it feels.

Rebecca: We’re doing “fine”, but it’s busy and noisy financially.

Abimanyu: First priority is resilience. Without a proper emergency fund, everything else is fragile.

James: That makes sense.

Abimanyu: After that, pensions and children’s futures — but not all at once.
