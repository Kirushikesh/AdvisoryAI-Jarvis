Date: 22 September 2024
Attendees: James Martinez, Rebecca Martinez, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Cashflow & Sequencing
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Your surplus is healthy, but it’s being mentally over-allocated.

Rebecca: That’s true. We want to do everything.

Abimanyu: The trick is sequencing. Emergency fund first, then pensions, then extensions and cars.

James: Otherwise we’ll feel permanently behind.

Abimanyu: Exactly.
