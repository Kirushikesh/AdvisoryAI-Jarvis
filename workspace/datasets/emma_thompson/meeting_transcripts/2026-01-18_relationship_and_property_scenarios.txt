**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 18 January 2026
Attendees: Emma Thompson, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Relationship Progression & Property Options
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Let’s talk about Tom and housing, because it affects everything else.

Emma: I know. I just don’t want to rush it.

Abimanyu: That caution makes sense given your parents’ history.

Emma: Exactly. I’m allergic to messy finances.

Abimanyu: Short term, moving into each other’s places without selling anything keeps flexibility.

Emma: That feels safer. Marriage and buying can wait.

Abimanyu: Then we plan for optionality, not commitment.
