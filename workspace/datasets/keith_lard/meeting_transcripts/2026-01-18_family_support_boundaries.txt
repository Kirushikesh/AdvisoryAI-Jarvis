Attendees: Keith Lard, Maureen Lard, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Family Support & Boundaries
-------------------------------------------

Maureen: I’m worried about Daniel. If things deteriorate, I don’t want him struggling.

Keith: But we can’t put everything at risk.

Abimanyu: That’s why we draw boundaries now, before emotion drives decisions.

Maureen: The £10k-at-18 approach still feels right.

Abimanyu: It protects generosity without undermining your own security.

Keith: Agreed.
