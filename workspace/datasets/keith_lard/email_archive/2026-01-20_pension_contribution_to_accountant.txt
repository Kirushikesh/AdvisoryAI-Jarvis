Subject: Company Pension Contribution – Keith Lard

Hi David,

As discussed, please proceed with the £180,000 employer pension contribution for Keith Lard’s SIPP before the company liquidation process begins.

This utilises carry-forward allowances and is the preferred extraction method.

Let us know once processed.

Kind regards,
Abimanyu
