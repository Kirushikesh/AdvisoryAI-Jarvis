**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 28 January 2025
Attendees: Delbert Wilkins, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Damien’s Trust Vesting
-------------------------------------------

Del: I’m worried he’ll blow the trust. Cars, nonsense, no discipline.

Abimanyu: The trust terms are locked. Control isn’t an option.

Del: Which annoys me.

Abimanyu: Influence is still available. Education, framing, guidance.

Del: I’d like you involved before it vests.

Abimanyu: That’s the right lever. Not authority — perspective.

Del: Good. Let’s do that.
