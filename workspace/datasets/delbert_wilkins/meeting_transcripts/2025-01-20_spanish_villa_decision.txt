**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 20 January 2025
Attendees: Delbert Wilkins, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Spanish Villa – Keep or Sell
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: You said on the phone the villa felt like more hassle than joy.

Del: That’s exactly it. I love it when I’m there. I hate it the rest of the time.

Abimanyu: Financially, keeping or selling is neutral. This is a lifestyle decision.

Del: Which tells me something. If I’m relieved by the idea of selling, that’s my answer.

Abimanyu: Then timing it after maintenance ends makes sense.

Del: Clean break. I like that.
