Topic: Spending Sustainability
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thank you both. I want to talk about how long the current setup lasts.

Hyacinth: We are perfectly comfortable.

Richard: I’m not sure that’s quite true.

Abimanyu: At present, income and spending are exactly matched. That leaves no room for shocks.

Hyacinth: We have always managed.

Abimanyu: And you still can — but only if big costs are controlled.

Richard: That’s what worries me.
