Topic: Sheridan Support
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: I want to be very clear. Unconditional support is the single biggest risk here.

Hyacinth: I will not abandon my son.

Abimanyu: Setting limits is not abandonment.

Richard: I think we need rules.

Hyacinth: Rules sound very cold.

Abimanyu: They’re what protect your future — and, ironically, Sheridan’s as well.
