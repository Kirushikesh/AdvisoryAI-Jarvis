Date: 12 January 2025
Attendees: David Chen, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Bonus Deployment & Tax Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Let’s start with the bonus. Sixty thousand gives us options.

David: My main aim is reducing the marginal tax pain.

Abimanyu: Understandable. VCTs, pension carry-forward, and ISA contributions together shelter a significant portion.

David: I’m comfortable with VCT risk at this level.

Abimanyu: Then thirty thousand over two years fits well and smooths exposure.

David: Good. Let’s proceed on that basis.
