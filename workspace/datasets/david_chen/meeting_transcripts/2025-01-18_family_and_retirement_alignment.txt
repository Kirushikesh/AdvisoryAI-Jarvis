**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 18 January 2025
Attendees: David Chen, Sarah Chen, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Family Priorities & Retirement Timing
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: I want to check alignment. Retirement at fifty-seven to fifty-eight is aggressive but feasible.

Sarah: Provided the children are secure, yes.

David: School fees are the main mental block.

Abimanyu: Once those end, your cashflow changes dramatically. That’s the release valve.

Sarah: And my hours — I may drop to three days.

Abimanyu: That’s affordable. It slightly slows LGPS accrual but improves quality of life.

David: That trade-off feels worth it.
