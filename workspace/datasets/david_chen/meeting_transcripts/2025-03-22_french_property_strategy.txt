**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 22 March 2025
Attendees: David Chen, Sarah Chen, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: French Property & Currency Risk
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: The Luberon properties you viewed sit right on budget.

Sarah: We loved the location, but I’m nervous about maintenance.

Abimanyu: That’s the hidden cost. Ten thousand a year is a fair assumption.

David: Currency risk is my bigger concern.

Abimanyu: Which is why staging the purchase and hedging exposure makes sense.

David: Agreed. No rush decision.
