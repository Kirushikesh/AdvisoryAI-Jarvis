Subject: Remortgage Options – Summary Attached

Hi David,

As discussed, I’ve attached the remortgage comparison.

Key trade-off is flexibility versus certainty:
- 5-year fix: lower rate, more optionality
- 10-year fix: higher rate, but aligns with retirement horizon

This becomes more nuanced if we layer in the French property, so I suggest we park a final decision until after the March trip.

Happy to talk it through.

Best,
Abimanyu
