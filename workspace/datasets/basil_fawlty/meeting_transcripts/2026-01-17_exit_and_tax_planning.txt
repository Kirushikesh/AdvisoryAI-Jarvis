Date: 17 January 2026
Attendees: Basil Fawlty, Sybil Fawlty, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Hotel Exit Strategy & Retirement Planning
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thanks both. I want to focus today on the exit timeline and the tax implications of delay.

Sybil: That’s exactly what I want to talk about.

Basil: I’m listening, but I won’t be rushed into a bad deal.

Abimanyu: Understood. Let me be clear on the numbers first. At a sale around £1.2 million, you’re looking at a capital gain of roughly nine hundred and twenty-five thousand.

Basil: Which is precisely why price matters.

Abimanyu: It does, but timing matters more. Business Asset Disposal Relief currently caps the tax at about ninety-two and a half thousand.

Sybil: And if that changes?

Abimanyu: If relief is lost, the tax bill could more than double. That risk increases the longer the sale drags on.

Basil: Legislation isn’t guaranteed to change.

Abimanyu: Correct. But planning assumes risk, not certainty.

Sybil: I don’t want to be running this place into our seventies.

Abimanyu: Which brings us to alternatives. A lease gives you immediate relief from day-to-day work, but ties up the asset and limits flexibility.

Basil: And puts our future in someone else’s hands.

Abimanyu: Exactly. It’s a bridge, not a destination.

Abimanyu: Financially, either route supports your £65,000 income target. This is not a money problem.

Sybil: It’s an energy problem.

Abimanyu: I agree. The question is how long you’re prepared to pay in stress to chase a higher price.

Basil: I need time to digest that.

Abimanyu: That’s fair. Before the next review, we need clarity on BADR eligibility, updated market evidence, and progress on wills and LPAs.

Sybil: Please let’s not delay those again.

Abimanyu: Agreed. Those are non-negotiable at this stage.
