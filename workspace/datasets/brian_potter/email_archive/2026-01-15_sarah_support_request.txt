Dad,

I really don’t want to worry you, but things are quite tight at the moment.

With Tom still out of work we’re managing, but it’s stressful and I wondered if you’d be open to helping us a little, just until things settle.

Please don’t feel any pressure — I completely understand if it’s not possible.

Love,
Sarah
