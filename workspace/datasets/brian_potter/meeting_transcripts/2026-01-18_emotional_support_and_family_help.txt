Attendees: Brian Potter, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Family Support & Emotional Check-in
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Brian, thank you for calling. Do you want to start with Sarah?

Brian: Yes. I hate seeing her struggle. Margaret would have helped without hesitation.

Abimanyu: And you’re allowed to honour that, provided it doesn’t compromise your own security.

Brian: That’s my worry. I don’t want to be careless.

Abimanyu: You wouldn’t be. A thirty-thousand-pound gift is affordable, but it needs to be transparent with Andrew.

Brian: I don’t want resentment between them.

Abimanyu: Then we document it clearly. No ambiguity.

Brian: That feels sensible.
