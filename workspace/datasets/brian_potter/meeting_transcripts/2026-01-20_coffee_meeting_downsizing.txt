-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Thank you for meeting, Brian. I’m glad we’re out rather than in the house.

Brian: The house is… quiet. Too quiet sometimes.

Abimanyu: Downsizing isn’t just financial. It’s emotional.

Brian: We lived there thirty-four years. Every room has a memory.

Abimanyu: Which is why there’s no deadline. But from a practical point of view, stairs and maintenance will get harder.

Brian: I know. My knees remind me daily.

Abimanyu: When the right place appears, the numbers will already work. That’s the part I can take off your plate.

Brian: I appreciate that. Margaret always handled the paperwork.

Abimanyu: Then we replace her systems gently, not abruptly.
