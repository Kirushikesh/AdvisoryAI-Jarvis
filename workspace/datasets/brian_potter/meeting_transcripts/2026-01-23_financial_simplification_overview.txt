Attendees: Brian Potter, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Simplifying Accounts & Next Steps
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: Today is about simplification, not decisions.

Brian: Good. I find it all overwhelming.

Abimanyu: At the moment you have eight savings accounts, two ISAs, and multiple platforms. We’ll reduce that to three providers.

Brian: That already feels better.

Abimanyu: I’ll prepare everything so you only need to sign.

Brian: Thank you. I don’t have the energy for forms.

Abimanyu: That’s exactly why we’re doing this together.
