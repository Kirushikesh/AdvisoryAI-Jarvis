Attendees: Robert Hughes, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Retirement Timing & Income Margin
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: The margin pre-state pension is tight but workable.

Robert: Tight makes me uncomfortable.

Abimanyu: That’s why sequencing matters. Partnership exit timing is the key lever.

Robert: I don’t want to stay longer than I have to.

Abimanyu: Then we need decisions this year, not next.
