**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 19 January 2026
Attendees: Rodney Trotter, Cassandra Trotter, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: House Purchase Pressure & Trust
-------------------------------------------

Cassandra: I need to feel we’re moving forward, not circling.

Rodney: I’m doing everything I can.

Abimanyu: Let me step in. Progress here means actions, not optimism.

Rodney: That feels harsh.

Abimanyu: It’s necessary. Housing is the emotional pressure point.

Cassandra: Exactly.

Abimanyu: Clear the loan, stabilise income, then we go to a broker. That’s the path.
