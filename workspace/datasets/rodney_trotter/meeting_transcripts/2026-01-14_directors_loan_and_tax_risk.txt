Attendees: Rodney Trotter, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Director’s Loan & Tax Exposure
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: I’m going to be very clear — this loan is a problem.

Rodney: It’s temporary. Cash just got stuck.

Abimanyu: HMRC doesn’t care why. Leaving it overdrawn creates tax and mortgage risk.

Rodney: Declaring the dividend feels painful.

Abimanyu: It’s less painful than S455 tax and lender rejection.

Rodney: …Alright. I hear you.
