Subject: Director’s Loan – Important Follow-Up

Hi Rodney,

Following our call, just to reiterate: leaving the director’s loan overdrawn exposes you to unnecessary tax and lender concerns.

Declaring the £12k dividend clears this cleanly and materially improves your mortgage profile.

This really is a priority action.

Best,
Abimanyu
