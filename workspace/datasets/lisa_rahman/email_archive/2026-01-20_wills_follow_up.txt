Subject: Wills – Solicitor Introduction

Hi Lisa,

Following up as promised — I’ve re-sent the details for the solicitor to update your wills and include both children, with guardianship for Mark confirmed.

No urgency panic, but it’s one of those things that’s much easier done calmly.

Let me know if you’d like me to chase on your behalf.

Best,
Abimanyu
