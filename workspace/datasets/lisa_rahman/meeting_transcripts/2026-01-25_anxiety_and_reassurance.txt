Abimanyu: Let me say this plainly — you are not failing.

Lisa: It doesn’t feel that way when everything costs more.

Abimanyu: That’s context, not consequence. In three years, this pressure eases automatically.

Lisa: Hearing that helps.

Abimanyu: Good. My job here is not optimisation — it’s keeping you steady through the squeeze.
