**Meeting Metadata**
Date: 22 January 2026
Attendees: Lisa Rahman, Ahmed Rahman, Abimanyu Chamika
Topic: Post-Maternity Financial Reset
-------------------------------------------

Abimanyu: The headline is simple — this year is tight, but temporary.

Lisa: It doesn’t feel temporary when you look at the numbers.

Abimanyu: That’s because you’re looking at peak childcare years. It’s the most expensive phase you’ll ever hit.

Ahmed: And we’re coping.

Abimanyu: Exactly. No debt increase, savings intact, emergency fund rebuilding. That’s success.
